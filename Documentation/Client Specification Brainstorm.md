# Client Specification Brainstorm
## Version 2 - 14th July 2020

<br>

The client is a mental health charity, who want a simple and streamlined way to monitor the progress of individuals at risk of relapse.

Unfortunately, the patient to psychiatrist number is exceedingly high, and the client needs an easy way for the referees to keep track of mood, and automatically select the best course of treatment for individuals.

A previously commissioned app was incredibly bulky, and as a result, patients often fall off and lose interest in updating their mood.

### Project requirements:

<br>

> Individuals log into the app, and every day, mark their mood from a selection of values.

> This COULD be done through pressing a button on screen to mark their mood, using emojis, with text underneath for autistic individuals.

> They must also be able to provide a short ‘twitter message’ style update.

> They could be also be able to select how many minutes of mindfulness practice they have achieved on a sliding scale.

> A client is then given a semi-personalised task for helping to improve or maintain their mood.

---

> A referee can log into the app, and see the progress of their patients.

> The referee should be able to leave a short, personalised reply.

> If a patient is ‘at risk’, the referee is notified immediately, and provided with the offending comment, as well as personal contact details.

---

> Referees should be able to log on and add new mindfulness tasks to an existing database.

> Both Patients and referees should be able to edit the response, if something bad happens in the day and needs immediate attention.

---

> There could be push or email notifications sent to the patient if they have forgotten to provide feedback that day.

> Perhaps a patient can track their mood over time with a graphical interface.

> The app could provide different motivating messages each day, so that the user won’t get bored.
