Client Specification Brainstorm


Client is a mental health charity, who want a simple and streamlined way to monitor the progress of individuals at risk of relapse.

A previously commissioned app was incredibly bulky, and as a result, patients often fall off and lose interest in updating their mood.

Project requirements:

> Individuals log into the app, and every day, press a button on screen to mark their mood through emojis.

> Must also have text underneath for autistic individuals.

> They must be also be able to select how many minutes of mindfulness practice they have achieved on a sliding scale.

> They should also be able to provide a short ‘twitter message’ style update.

——

> A referee can log into the app, and see the progress of their patients.

> The referee should be able to leave a short, personalised reply.

> If a patient is ‘at risk’, the referee is notified immediately, and provided with the offending comment, as well as personal contact details.

——

> Patients should be notified when a referee comments.

> Both Patients and referees should be able to edit the response, if something bad happens in the day and needs immediate attention.

——

> There could be push or email notifications sent to the patient if they have forgotten to provide feedback that day.

> Perhaps a patient can track their mood over time with a graphical interface.

> The app could provide different motivating messages each day, so that the user won’t get bored.
